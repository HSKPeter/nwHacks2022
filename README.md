# Lost n Found

## About th project
Sometimes it might be annoying when you lose something. In this digital era, you might be tempted to search in local Facebook groups, local subreddits, or even stick to the traditional way, which is going to the police station and trying to find it.

Yet, with this “Lost & Found” app, we aim to provide a modern solution to this problem by providing an AI-integrated platform for searchers to find their items, and for reporters to report what they have picked up.

For reporters, with the state-of-the-art AI photo-detecting technology, you will have all the information at your fingertips. Just one tap to upload or take a picture, and we will handle all the descriptions for you. Hassle-free reporting and helping others are just killing two birds with one stone.

For searchers, our AI word suggestion would provide the most suitable keywords after the description of your items has been inputted, and thus greatly enhance search accuracy and the chances of finding your item.
